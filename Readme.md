# A couple of simple custom parts I designed while building my Voron 0.2

## 'Stronger' M2 nut bar and M3 no drop nut retainer

Much easier to print with a bit more material on the bottom and sits a little more securely in the extrusion. Fits MakerBeamXL-style 1515 aluminium extrusion.

## BTT Pi Mount

A mount for the BTT Pi v1.2 that came with my Formbot parts kit. This one has a slightly different mounting hole pattern, which means that none of the mounts included with the V0.2 fit.

Designed to work with the Voron DIN cleats and clips.
