# A couple of simple custom parts I designed while building my Voron 0.2

## 'Stronger' [M2 nut bar](STLs/V02%20Parts-StrongerNutBar%20M2.stl) and [M3 no drop nut retainer](STLs/V02%20Parts-StrongerNoDropNut%20M3.stl)

Much easier to print with a bit more material on the bottom and sits a little more securely in the extrusion. Fits MakerBeamXL-style 1515 aluminium extrusion.

## [BTT Pi Mount](STLs/V02%20Parts-BTT%20Pi%20v1.2%20Mount.stl)

A mount for the BTT Pi v1.2 that came with my Formbot parts kit. This one has a slightly different mounting hole pattern, which means that none of the mounts included with the V0.2 fit.

Designed to work with the Voron DIN cleats and clips.
